# d3dx9_43.dll
DirectX 9 is no longer available to download from Microsoft, and there is no safe way to get it on Windows 10.
Some games (Stepmania) still require it, so I have uploaded the dll from one of my older machines.
This is the x64 release version 43 dll from June 2010, the last DX9 release.
If anyone trusts me and needs the debug dll, 32 bit version, or a different release number I can provide those as well.
